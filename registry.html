        <p>While gifts are not required, we are thankful for anything that can be given to help us in
 	   this transition together! These are our wants and needs for our future household. We appreciate anything
           you can purchase for us! Please no substitutions or added items as we do not have room to store added items or decor.
           Please include gift receipts for items in case something is broken or does not work upon delivery!
           There also is an option to donate towards our honeymoon if you are unsure of what item to get or would rather send cash!
           Any checks written can be made out to "Zachary Sledge" with the memo as "wedding."</p>
