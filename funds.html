	<h1>Honeymoon Fund</h1>
	<p>This money will be used for our honeymoon! As well as any last minute household needs we did not think about or items that were not purchased!</p>
	<p>We greatly appreciate everything bought or any money being sent! Thank you for supporting us in this new chapter!</p>
	<p>You can select your preferred payment method below.</p>
	<p>Any checks written can be made out to "Zachary Sledge" with the memo as "Wedding." <br> (This allows for all checks to be cashed without a problem during the name change!)</p>
	<p2> Note: There will be a 3% processing charge on all credit card transactions.</p2>
